The difference between dependencies and devdependencies is that devdependencies
are modules that are used only during developement process, while dependencies are
required in developement and at runtime. To install package as devDependency
we need to install it with "-D" (hyphen-D) or "--save-dev" flags.
Parcel, Babel, Webpack are examples of devDependancies. This libraries are not shipped to the browser.
